# HR Analytics

## Problem Statement:

The HR Director of a company has recently noticed an increase in employees leaving (attrition). She would like to figure out any trends or patterns. She has surveyed the staff and provided you with the data.

She would like to know what the attrition rate is (% of people who have left).

She would also like to know if factors like age, years at the company and income play a part in determining if people will leave or not.


## Lessons

### Loading the dataset

Data is available in CSV Format. Just Click on the Text/CSV on the Landing page in the data source section. Search for the path and just load the data.


### Sheet 1 - AgeWise Employee count:

Firstly, Create a new column age(groups) by taking the age column and grouping them into 5 age groups namely-
18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56-60.

Then Create a stacked barchart showing employee count by age group. To show attrition, click and drag the attrition column to colors in the Marks Shelf.

Columns: Employee Count (sum)

### Sheet 2- Average Monthly Income by age:

Dual barchart showing average monthly income by age group and another chart showing how much each age group is earning based on the average income of the whole company.

Firstly, Create a level of detal expression (LOD), for this create a calculated field for average per age group and write the following formula
{fixed [Age (group)] : AVG([Monthly Income])}

Now create another LOD expression by creating a calculated field and using the following formula
{fixed : AVG([Monthly Income])}

Now create a calculated field to show Amount from age group using formula
SUM([Total Average])-SUM([Avg per age group])

Rows : Average per age group(sum) and Amount from group average(average)
